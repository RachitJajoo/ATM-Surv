# Team: Burger And Fries
<h1>Project: ATM Surveillance</h1>
<h3>This is Team 32's Repository.</h3>

<h2>What is our Project?</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our model basically works on the grading system.</li>
      <li>The minute a person enters the system, the system starts monitoring their actions.</li>
      <li>The system flags a person based on his behaviour and actions.</li>
      <li>If a certain threshold of flags is crossed then the person is marked as suspicious and the doors of the ATM are closed trapping the             person inside.</li>
      <li>Voila! Police is automatically alerted and a possible hostage situation, robbery or theft is mitigated.</li>
     </ul>
    </p>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>Python</ul>
<ul>OpenCV</ul>
<ul>Haar Cascade</ul>
